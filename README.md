# Union Shop (Flutter)

An educational e-commerce Flutter app showcasing a simple online shop with login, product browsing, cart management, and a shipping/checkout flow. Built with Flutter and Firebase, it’s structured for cross‑platform development (Android, iOS, Web, Windows, Linux, macOS) and includes unit/widget tests.

## Features
- **Login/Authentication:** Email/password sign-in backed by Firebase (`lib/login.dart`, `lib/auth_service.dart`).
- **Browse Collections & Products:** View product lists and details (`lib/collections.dart`, `lib/product.dart`).
- **Cart Management:** Add/remove items, view totals, persist cart state (`lib/cart.dart`, `lib/cart_repository.dart`).
- **Shipping** Shipping Info (`lib/shipping.dart`).
- **About Page & Stylesheet:** App info and centralized theming (`lib/about_.dart`, `lib/stylesheet.dart`).
- **Cross-Platform Targets:** Android, iOS, Web, Windows, Linux, macOS platform folders present.
- **Tests Included:** Unit and widget tests under `test/` (products, cart, styles, home, etc.).

## Prerequisites
- **OS:** Windows 10/11 recommended (PowerShell 5.1). Works on macOS/Linux with equivalent tooling.
- **Flutter SDK:** 3.x or later. Install from https://flutter.dev.
- **Dart:** Included with Flutter.
- **Android Tooling (optional):** Android Studio + SDK for device/emulator.
- **iOS Tooling (optional, macOS only):** Xcode + Cocoapods.
- **Web:** Chrome preferred for `flutter run -d chrome`.
- **Firebase project:** Required if running auth-backed flows. The repo includes `lib/firebase_options.dart` (generated by FlutterFire).

## Installation
Use Windows PowerShell commands.

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Beaujo-sys/https---github.com-Beaujo-sys-union_shop.git
cd https---github.com-Beaujo-sys-union_shop/shop-main

# Fetch dependencies
flutter pub get

# Verify Flutter environment
flutter doctor
```

### Firebase Setup (if needed)
The app references `lib/firebase_options.dart` generated by FlutterFire. If you need to connect to your own Firebase project:
- Install CLI: `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`.
- Configure: `flutterfire configure` and choose platforms.
- Ensure `lib/firebase_options.dart` exists and matches your Firebase project.
- Confirm platform config files (e.g., `android/app/google-services.json`, `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`) if used.

## Running the App
```powershell
# Run on default device (choose from prompt)
flutter run

# Run on specific targets
flutter run -d windows
flutter run -d chrome
flutter run -d android


### Building
```powershell
# Web (release build)
flutter build web

# Android APK
flutter build apk

# Windows desktop
flutter build windows
```

## Usage
- **Login:** Launch the app and authenticate via the login screen (`lib/login.dart`). 
- **Home/Collections:** Browse product collections (`lib/collections.dart`).
- **Product Details:** Tap an item to view details and add to cart (`lib/product.dart`).
- **Cart:** Open the cart to update quantities or remove items (`lib/cart.dart`, `lib/cart_repository.dart`).
- **About & Styling:** See about page and global styles (`lib/about_.dart`, `lib/stylesheet.dart`).

### Configuration
- **Assets:** Static assets are under `Assets/` and `build/flutter_assets`. Use `pubspec.yaml` to declare assets; ensure paths are correct when adding new images.
- **Firebase:** Managed via `lib/firebase_options.dart`. Re-run FlutterFire if changing projects.
- **Analysis/Style:** See `analysis_options.yaml` for lint rules. Styling centralization in `lib/stylesheet.dart`.

### Running Tests
```powershell
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run a single file
flutter test test/product_test.dart
```
Tests cover products, cart behavior, styles, home screen, shipping, about, and main app bootstrapping (see `test/*.dart`).

## Project Structure

	- `shipping.dart`: Shipping and checkout steps.
	- `about_.dart`: About page.
	- `stylesheet.dart`: Theme and shared styles.
	- `firebase_options.dart`: FlutterFire config.
- `Assets/`: Images and other static resources.
- `test/`: Unit/widget tests for core features.
- Platform folders: `android/`, `ios/`, `web/`, `windows/`, `linux/`, `macos/`.
- Build artifacts: `build/` (auto-generated).

## Technologies & Dependencies
- **Framework:** Flutter + Dart.
- **Firebase (FlutterFire):** Used for authentication/config via `firebase_options.dart`.
- **Testing:** `flutter_test` and widget tests under `test/`.
- **Platform toolchains:** Android Studio, Xcode, Chrome, Windows Desktop as applicable.
